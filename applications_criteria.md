# PAL Applications Criteria

All applications under PAL are processed based on two sets of criteria: [eligibility criteria](#eligibility-criteria) and [criteria for prioritisation]{#cri}.

## Eligibility Criteria {#eligibility}

In order to be eligible for funding under PAL, every application must cover the complete list of eligibility criteria:

1. The applicant must be a parachain which is producing blocks on the Polkadot network;
2. The application must specify which Substrate pallets or ink! smart contracts would be audited including refs to GitHub and a summary of the total number lines of code;
3. The code must be open source;
4. The code must be production-ready and under development-freeze - no new commits are allowed unless agreed with the auditors (fixes of identified bugs);
5. The Polkadot Audit Fund will cover a maximum of 80% of the auditing costs up to a limit of 18,000 DOT. The applicant parachain must be ready to cover the remaining costs;
6. The applicant parachain will receive the funding from the bounty mechanism in DOT. The applicant may need to handle the payment to the auditor directly in stablecoins or fiat.

## Criteria for Prioritisation {#prioritization}

If there are more applications under PAL in a given round than the available funding, the eligible applications will be subjected to the following criteria to determine priority:

1. Count of active wallets;
2. Count of open bi-directional HRMP/XCM channels;
3. TVL on that chain or some other quantifiable measure of the interest at stake;
4. Number of completed audits in the past.
