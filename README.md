## About PAL
The Polkadot Assurance Legion (PAL) is an initiative of the Polkadot community which aims to increase the auditing capacity of the ecosystem. It has received funds from the Polkadot treasury (a bounty) which will be used to help selected consumers of blockspace undergo audits, and to onboard more auditors to Rust / Polkadot SDK. The ultimate goal is to make Polkadot a more secure and accessible ecosystem to build in.
