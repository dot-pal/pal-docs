## About PAL
The [Polkadot Assurance Legion](https://polkadotassurance.com/) (PAL) is an initiative of the Polkadot community which aims to increase the auditing capacity of the ecosystem. It has received funds from the Polkadot treasury (through [a bounty](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/referenda/47)) which will be used to help selected consumers of blockspace undergo audits, and to onboard more auditors to Rust / Polkadot SDK. The ultimate goal is to make Polkadot a more secure and accessible ecosystem to build in.
