# Curator Information

PAL is managed by a group of 7 curators with relevant expertise in the Polkadot ecosystem. The curators play a crucial role in the administration and decision-making processes of PAL.

## Curator Responsibilities

- Review and evaluate applications for funding
- Maintain relationships with audit partners

- Continuously monitor and update eligibility criteria and prioritization processes

Curators are compensated with a monthly salary of $3,000 worth of DOT per curator. This ensures that curators are adequately incentivized to dedicate sufficient time to PAL responsibilities.

* Only expenses related to PAL are covered
* The expenses should be documented internally (link to tx, invoice etc)
