* Only expenses related to PAL are covered
* The expenses should be documented internally (link to tx, invoice etc)
* Every curator has an annual travel budget of $ 3,000
* The travel budget can be claimed only for activities related to PAL (eg security-related conferences; BD with auditors, whitehats or parachain teams)
