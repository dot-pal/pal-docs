- [ ] Substrate-specific coding conventions followed

#### For Solidity Projects:
- [ ] Solidity style guide followed
- [ ] Latest stable Solidity version used
- [ ] Linter (e.g., Solhint) run with all warnings addressed
- [ ] Static analysis (slither) run with warnings addressed

#### Common:
- [ ] Consistent naming conventions used throughout the codebase
- [ ] Functions and variables have clear, descriptive names
- [ ] Complex logic broken down into smaller, manageable functions
- [ ] Unused code, commented-out code, and TODO comments addressed

### 2.2 Documentation

#### For Substrate Projects:
- [ ] Rust doc comments for all public functions and types
- [ ] Purpose and functionality of each pallet documented
- [ ] Interactions between pallets explained

#### For Solidity Projects:
- [ ] NatSpec comments for all public functions and state variables
- [ ] Purpose and functionality of each contract documented
- [ ] Contract inheritance and interface implementations explained

#### Common:
- [ ] README file with project overview, setup instructions, and usage guide
- [ ] Architecture documentation, including component interactions and data flow
- [ ] Tokenomics and economic model documentation (if applicable)
- [ ] Upgrade process documented (for upgradeable systems)

## 3. Testing and Quality Assurance

### 3.1 Test Coverage

#### For Substrate Projects:
- [ ] Unit tests for individual functions within pallets
- [ ] Integration tests using mock runtimes
- [ ] Property-based tests implemented

#### For Solidity Projects:
- [ ] Unit tests for individual functions
- [ ] Integration tests for contract interactions
- [ ] Property-based and fuzz testing implemented

#### Common:
- [ ] Test coverage of at least 90% achieved
- [ ] Edge cases and potential attack vectors tested
- [ ] Regression tests for previously identified vulnerabilities in place

### 3.2 Benchmarking and Gas Optimization

#### For Substrate Projects:
- [ ] Benchmarks implemented for all dispatchable functions
- [ ] Weight calculations accurate and optimized

#### For Solidity Projects:
- [ ] Gas usage for all functions measured and optimized
- [ ] Gas limits for functions set appropriately

## 4. Security Considerations

### 4.1 Common Security Measures
- [ ] Secure randomness generation implemented
- [ ] Safe arithmetic operations used to prevent over/underflows
- [ ] Reentrancy vulnerabilities addressed
- [ ] Access control mechanisms properly implemented
- [ ] Input validation and sanitization in place
- [ ] Event emission for all important state changes

### 4.2 Substrate-Specific Security
- [ ] Proper depth limits set for decoding to prevent unbounded recursion
- [ ] XCM (Cross-Consensus Messaging) properly secured
- [ ] Storage exhaustion attacks mitigated

### 4.3 Solidity-Specific Security
- [ ] Use of `transfer()` or `send()` replaced with `call()` for ETH transfers
- [ ] Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern followed
- [ ] Front-running possibilities analyzed and mitigated
- [ ] Oracle usage secured (if applicable)

### 4.4 Moonbeam-Specific Considerations (for Solidity on Polkadot)
- [ ] Arbitrary code execution risks addressed
- [ ] Precompile interactions reviewed for security
- [ ] Function selector whitelisting implemented for sensitive functions
- [ ] Contract address whitelisting used where appropriate
- [ ] tx.origin vs msg.sender checks reviewed and secured

### 4.5 Dependency Management
- [ ] All dependencies up-to-date
- [ ] Known vulnerabilities in dependencies checked and addressed
- [ ] Minimal use of external dependencies

## 5. Deployment and Upgrade Strategy

- [ ] Deployment scripts prepared and tested
- [ ] Upgrade mechanism (if any) thoroughly tested
- [ ] Emergency stop functionality implemented (if applicable)
- [ ] Key management strategy defined
- [ ] Multi-sig wallets set up for critical operations (if applicable)

## 6. Audit Preparation

- [ ] All known issues and their planned fixes documented
- [ ] List of specific areas of concern or focus for auditors prepared
- [ ] Previous audit reports (if any) and their remediations documented
- [ ] Clear explanation of any custom cryptography or novel algorithms prepared
- [ ] Documentation on any off-chain components that interact with the contracts

## 7. Post-Audit Planning

- [ ] Process for addressing audit findings defined
- [ ] Timeline for implementing fixes established
- [ ] Plan for potential re-audit or review of fixes in place
- [ ] Strategy for communicating audit results to the community prepared

## 8. Ongoing Security Measures

- [ ] Continuous monitoring system for deployed contracts/pallets planned
- [ ] Regular security review process established
- [ ] Plan for staying updated on new security developments in the ecosystem
- [ ] Incident response plan developed

Remember, this checklist is a general guide and may need to be adapted based on the specific requirements of your project and the blockchain platform you're building on. Regular reviews and updates to this checklist are recommended as the project evolves and new security considerations emerge in the blockchain space.
