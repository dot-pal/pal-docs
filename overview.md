2. **Achievements**: PAL has distributed 157,155 DOT to co-fund 14 Rust security audits of 11 Polkadot parachains, helping mitigate 18 High-risk vulnerabilities that could have potentially resulted in loss of user funds.

3. **Scope**: PAL's scope includes:
   - Audits for Polkadot coretime consumers
   - Audits for Solidity smart contracts on Polkadot
   - Audits for Polkadot relay chain and system chains
   - Funding for common-good security tooling
   - Support for other common-good security initiatives

4. **Funding**: PAL is funded through a bounty from the Polkadot treasury, with funding limits and criteria tailored to different project types.

5. **Management**: PAL is managed by a group of 7 curators with relevant expertise in the Polkadot ecosystem, compensated with a monthly salary.

6. **Transparency**: PAL maintains accountability by preparing reports with summaries of audit findings and publishing them to the Polkadot community.

## Current Operations

1. Eligibility for funding includes Polkadot coretime consumers, Solidity smart contracts on Polkadot, and Polkadot relay chain and system chains.
2. Funding is available for common-good security tooling and other security initiatives.
